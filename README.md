# Item-Tracker

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project organizes a list of items from a grocery store, so that said store can keep track of the amount of each item they have.  

# What did you do particularly well?
This was a final project from a CS class, so a small portion of the code (specifically the parts that connect the C++ file and the Python file) was given to me, but I did well at producing a clean, user-friendly interface that allowed the grocery store to quickly and easily determine the quantity of items.  

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could make the histogram properly formatted, so that all the stars would start at the same spot.  This would make the histogram much more readable.  

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I had the most trouble with the histogram portion of the code, because it required me to transfer data from multiple files to get the final product of the histogram.  I overcame this by breaking down the problem into a series of small steps, and completing one at a time until the histogram was complete.  

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I am now more comfortable with reading and writing to files, and I now see the benefit of doing so at certain times.  I also better understand the value of breaking down a large problem into smaller steps before tackling it as a whole.  

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program follows basic style guides for Python and C++, including good variable names, proper whitespace, and clean code in general.  It has input validation that ensures the user interface is simplistic and easy to use, and has several functions, each of which are relatively small and simple.
